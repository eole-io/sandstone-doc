Sandstone is built on a few other cool PHP libraries you may want to check documentation:

- [Silex 2](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) *for RestApi and application container ([Pimple](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/))*
- [Ratchet PHP](http://socketo.me/) *for websockets*
- [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) *for Push server*
- [WAMP protocol](http://wamp-proto.org/) (**v1**) *for topics pub/sub*
- [JMS Serializer](http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer) *to ensure serialization/deserialization between Sandstone components and client*
- [Symfony EventDispatcher](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/event_dispatcher/introduction.html) *for Push server abstraction `->forwardEventToPushServer()`*
- [Symfony Routing](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing/introduction.html) *for Topic declaration abstraction `$app->topic('chat{general}')`*


## WAMP protocol v1

Sandstone uses the first version of WAMP protocol.

This choice has be done over the v2 because at this time, **server-side**,
this version is better documented than the v2.

The library Ratchet PHP, which uses wamp v1, is well documented.
It allows to create topic classes extending `Ratchet\Wamp\Topic`,
and helps to structure the code.


## Push messages abstraction

There were a problem to send message from rest api to websocket server,
which are **two differents thread**.

To resolve this problem, I needed to use tcp sockets:
the websocket server opens and listen to a socket,
while the rest api send tcp messages to the socket.

First, I used ZMQ to abstract socket creation and listen with PHP.

But I don't want to use ZMQ directly in rest api controller to send messages,
and make controllers dependant to ZMQ.

I wanted to send events from controllers to websocket topics by
only dispatching Symfony events, which is **one of the main Sandstone feature**.

So messages becomes events:

- we can dispatch events the usual way from controllers,
- then Sandstone listens these events,
- serialize them using JMS serializer,
- send them through socket,
- catch them the other side in the websocket server,
- then re-disptach them using Symfony EventDispatcher.

That way, you can magically listen an event from a websocket topic,
that is sent from a rest api controller:

Rest Api:

``` php
// rest api controller
$app['dispatcher']->dispatch('article.created', $event);
```

``` php
// rest api stack
$app->forwardEventToPushServer('article.created');
```

Websocket server:

``` php
// websocket topic
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;

class ChatTopic extends Eole\Sandstone\Websocket\Topic implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    public static function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return [
            'article.created' => 'onArticleCreated',
        ];
    }

    public function onArticleCreated(ArticleEvent $event)
    {
        $this->broadcast([
            'type' => 'article_created',
            'message' => 'An article has just been published: '.$event->title.', read it here: '.$event->url,
        ]);
    }
}
```

Note that Sandstone will not forward *all* events to websocket server,
just declare the ones you want to forward with `$app->forwardEventToPushServer('my_event')`.


## Websocket topics

I wanted to declare topics as simple as Silex does with routes,
which is **one of the main Sandstone feature**.

How Silex declares a route:

``` php
$app = new Silex\Application();

// Or using Sandstone:
$app = new Eole\Sandstone\Application();

$app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) use ($app) {
    return 'Hello '.$app->escape($name);
});
```

How Sandstone declares a websocket topic:

``` php
$app = new Eole\Sandstone\Application();

$app->topic('chat/{channel}', function ($topicPattern, $arguments) {
    return new ChatTopic($topicPattern);
});
```

And you can also use constraints like:

``` php
$app
    ->topic('chat/{channel}', function ($topicPattern, $arguments) {
        return new ChatTopic($topicPattern);
    })
    ->value('channel', 'general')                   // Put a default value
    ->assert('channel', '^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$')           // Accept only characters for channel name
    ->convert('channel', function () { /* ... */ })
    ->before(function () { /* ... */ })
    ->when('chatEnabled()')
;
```

Then when someone subscribes to the topic `chat/general` for the first time,
this factory is called with arguments:

```
Array
(
    [topicPattern] => 'chat/general'
    [arguments] => Array
        (
            [channel] => general
        )
)
```
